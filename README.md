■ Project Description

The School Management System is a Java-based application designed to simulate key administrative operations in a school setup. It allows management of students, courses, book borrowing, and fee records — making it a comprehensive solution for academic administration.

■■ Main Features
1	Student Management — Register and manage student information.
2	Course Management — Add, enroll, and manage course capacities.
3	Fee Management — Record and track student fee payments.
4	Library System — Borrow and return books with stock tracking.
5	Performance Tracking — Calculate and display top student performances.
6	Queue Management — Process registration requests using a Circular Queue.

■ Technologies Used

1	Language: Java
2	IDE: Visual Studio Code / IntelliJ IDEA
3	Data Structures Used: HashMap, Queue (LinkedList & CircularQueue), Stack, PriorityQueue, TreeMap

■ How to Run the Project

1 Download or clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/mikenjorogen254-creator/SchoolManagementProject 2 Open the project folder in VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA.and unzip the folder because it was ziped since it couldnt be uploaded directly
3	Ensure all .java files are inside the folder: src/schoolmanagement/
4	Compile all Java files: javac schoolmanagement/*.java
5	Run the main demo: java schoolmanagement.SMSDemo
6.Or apparently run each file.java separately

■ Concepts Demonstrated

1	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
2	Use of Java Collections Framework for data handling.
3	Simulation of real-world school activities (fees, courses, and library).
■ Conclusion

This project was developed as part of a group assignment (Group 2) for academic purposes. Special thanks to all group members for their teamwork and dedication — and to Mike Njuguna for leading development and integration of all system modules.
